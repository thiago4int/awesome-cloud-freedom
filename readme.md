# Cloud-Agnostic and Cloud-Native Providers


Welcome to the **Cloud-Agnostic and Cloud-Native Providers** repository! This curated list features tools and platforms designed to offer **freedom, flexibility, and cost-efficiency** for users who want to avoid vendor lock-in, leverage open-source technology, or self-host their infrastructure.

---

## What is Cloud-Agnostic, Cloud-Native, and Open-Source?

- **Cloud-Agnostic**: Platforms that can run on multiple cloud providers, giving organizations the freedom to move workloads between clouds without vendor lock-in.
  
- **Cloud-Native**: Platforms built to take full advantage of the cloudâ€™s capabilities, including scalability, containerization, and automation.

- **Open-Source**: Platforms or technologies that provide transparency, freedom to modify, and the ability to self-host. Open-source tools empower users to maintain control over their data and applications.

## Categories

To help you find the right tools for your needs, this repository organizes cloud-agnostic and cloud-native platforms into the following categories:

- [Databases](./databases/databases.md)
- [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/kubernetes.md)
- [App Hosting & Edge Computing](./app-hosting-edge-computing/app-hosting-edge-computing.md)
- [Storage](./storage/storage.md)
- [End-User List](./end-user-list/end-user-list.md)
- [Cloud Platforms](./cloud-platforms/cloud-platforms.md)



Each category includes details on whether the platform is **cloud-agnostic**, **cloud-native**, **open-source**, and whether it supports **self-hosting**. Some platforms also offer **free tiers** or trials, which are noted where applicable.
